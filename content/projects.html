<p>AstroML is a Python module for machine learning and data mining in
Astronomy and Astrophysics.  It contains many commonly-used tools from
the astronomical literature, and hundreds of examples of their use.  I
wrote this package to accompany our textbook, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Statistics-Mining-Machine-Learning-Astronomy/dp/0691151687/" target="tab">Statistics, Data Mining,
and Machine Learning in Astronomy</a></i>.</p>

<p>Scikit-Learn is a powerful and extensive machine learning library
written in Python.  I have
contributed in many areas of the project, but primarily in the area of
generalized N-point problems & manifold learning.</p>

<p>mpld3 is a project which leverages <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3js</a> to
produce interactive browser-based visualizations from matplotlib figures.
Though interactive, the resulting figures are not tied to the Python kernel,
so they can be used statically on web pages and blogs.
To see mpld3 in action, take a look at my initial
<a href="http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/12/19/a-d3-viewer-for-matplotlib/">blog post</a>, or see some examples
<a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jakevdp/mpld3/tree/master/examples/">here</a> and

<p>SciDB-Py is a set of python wrappers for the
<a href="http://scidb.org/">SciDB</a> project which provides a natural,
numpy-like interface to large-scale array-based computations.  The project is
a collaboration between myself and the
folks at <a href="http://www.paradigm4.com/">Paradigm4</a>.</p>

<p>Scipy is a collection of Python tools for scientific computing.  My main
contributions have been in the sparse matrix toolkit, primarily in iterative
sparse matrix decompositions and fast graph algorithms.</p>
