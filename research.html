<h2>Current Role</h2>
<p><b>I am currently a Research Geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey.
I study the complex inter-relations between fluid flows, landforms, sediment transport and sedimentology.
My research approach is interdisciplinary in sedimentology, coastal and hydraulic engineering, and geophysics,
applying methodologies ranging from field surveys and laboratory analysis to analytical and numerical modeling.
Of special interest to me is geostatistical analyses, computational geomorphology and sedimentology,
stochastic modeling techniques, instrument design, and the remote characterization of
sedimentary environments, which includes sensing the properties of flows and particles at rest
and in motion, in single and multiphase flows, both terrestrial and subaqueous, by developing
and applying novel acoustics and optics instrumentation and computational algorithms
Additionally, I invest time in supporting, developing, and
maintaining various open source scientific packages
in the Python world. Through all of this, I enjoy working on the instrumentational and computational
methodologies that are helping push forward geosciences research in the
era of ever-growing datasets.</b></p>

<h2>My Research</h2>
<p><b>Principally, I measure sediment: what is it made of; what lives in or on it; how it gets picked up by flows of
air and water; how it gets deposited into landforms; how these processes evolve in time due to
feedback processes; how it gets preserved in the rock record. The properties of sediment (grain
size, shape, packing, cohesion, etc) fundamentally control what grows in or on it; how fast and
far it moves; how long it stays there. These properties govern the dynamics of air and water
turbulence; water turbidity; formation of dunes in deserts, rivers and seas; the attenuation and
scattering of light and sound; and landform stability. Documenting and understanding how
sediment properties change in time and space is fundamental to understanding and modeling the
hydraulics of open channel flow; the mechanics of sediment transport in water and air; the
evolution of landforms; and the distribution of primary producers which support ecosystems of
all types.</b></p>

<!-- I am intellectually stimulated by the dynamic role of sediments in sediment transport,
geomorphology and aquatic habitats, mediated by how sedimentary materials change in space
and time. Measuring sediment properties (such as grain size) of a given sample is obviously well established.
However, measuring the properties of sediments continuously in time or in space is notoriously difficult,
because it precludes physical sampling of the sediment and subsequent
laboratory analysis, which is prohibitively time-consuming and expensive, as well as physically
and ecologically destructive. Instead, sediment properties need to be remotely sensed.
Traditionally, this has imposed severe limits on how sediment properties have been incorporated
as a dynamic variable into models and understanding of physical and biological processes,
allowing only a static role of sedimentary materials as a boundary or context to contemporary
earth surface and ecological processes, and the dynamics of environmental change. In reality,
sediment is both dependent and independent variable in many of these processes, and should be
measured and modelled continuously in time like flows of water and populations of organisms.
Understanding these processes requires being able to measure sediments properties at high
temporal and spatial resolution and great spatial coverage.</p> -->
